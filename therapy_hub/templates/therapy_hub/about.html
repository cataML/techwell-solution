            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Ever since I can remember, Iâ€™ve been drawn to understanding peopleâ€”their emotions, struggles, and unique journeys. My own 
                experiences with [personal challenge, if comfortable sharing] taught me the power of having a safe space to talk, reflect, 
                and heal.  Thatâ€™s why I became a counselorâ€”to offer that same support to others.</p>
                <p>"With 3 years of experience as a Licensed 
                Therapist, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of guiding individuals through anxiety, self-doubt, relationship challenges, 
                and life transitions. </p>
                <p>My approach is warm, non-judgmental, and tailored to youâ€”because I believe healing happens when you 
                feel truly heard and understood." "One of the most rewarding moments in my work is seeing someone rediscover their 
                strengthâ€”the moment they realize they are capable, resilient, and worthy of happiness. Iâ€™ve worked with so many individuals 
                who once felt stuck but found their way forward with the right support. If youâ€™re feeling lost, know that you donâ€™t have to 
                do this alone."</p>
                <p>ðŸ’™ You deserve support, healing, and clarity. Letâ€™s take this journey together.</p>
